## Overview
The Coralogix Operator provides Kubernetes-native deployment and management for Coralogix, 
designed to simplify and automate the configuration of Coralogix APIs through Kubernetes [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/).

The operator integrates with Kubernetes by supporting a variety of custom resources and controllers to simplify Coralogix management, including:
- **Custom Resources for Coralogix:** Easily deploy and manage Coralogix features, using custom resources like
[Alerts](https://github.com/coralogix/coralogix-operator/tree/master/config/samples/alerts), 
[RecordingRuleGroupSets](https://github.com/coralogix/coralogix-operator/tree/master/config/samples/recordingrulegroupset),
[RuleGroups](https://github.com/coralogix/coralogix-operator/tree/master/config/samples/rulegroups), [OutboundWebhooks](https://github.com/coralogix/coralogix-operator/tree/master/config/samples/outboundwebhooks) and others.
For a complete list of available APIs and their details, refer to the [API documentation](https://github.com/coralogix/coralogix-operator/tree/master/docs/api.md).
- **Prometheus Operator Integration:** The Operator leverages [Prometheus Operator](https://prometheus-operator.dev/) CRDs like PrometheusRule and AlertmanagerConfig,
to simplify the transition to Coralogix by utilizing existing monitoring configurations.
For more details on this integration, see the [Prometheus Integration documentation](https://github.com/coralogix/coralogix-operator/tree/master/docs/prometheus-integration.md).
- **Running Multiple Instances:** The operator supports running multiple instances within a single cluster by using label selectors.
For more details, see the [Running Multiple Instances documentation](https://github.com/coralogix/coralogix-operator/tree/master/docs/multi-instance-operator.md).


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

### Helm Installation
1. For using the official helm chart, add the Coralogix repository and update it:
```sh
helm repo add coralogix https://cgx.jfrog.io/artifactory/coralogix-charts-virtual
helm repo update
```

2. Install the operator with Helm:
```sh
helm install <my-release> coralogix/coralogix-operator \
  --set secret.data.apiKey="<api-key>" \
  --set coralogixOperator.region="<region>"
```
 - To install the operator with its validation webhooks, add the `--set coralogixOperator.webhooks.enabled=true` flag. 
This requires cert-manager to be installed in the cluster. 
A [certificate](./charts/coralogix-operator/templates/certificate.yaml) and an [issuer](./charts/coralogix-operator/templates/issuer.yaml) will be installed on the cluster.
 - The Prometheus-Operator integration assumes its CRDs are installed. If you wish to disable this integration, add the `--set prometheusOperator.prometheusRules.enabled=false` flag.

3. To uninstall the operator, run:
```sh
helm delete <my-release>
```
 
### Local Installation with Kustomize
1. Clone the operator repository and navigate to the project directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/coralogix/coralogix-operator.git 
cd coralogix-operator
```

2. Set the Coralogix API key and region as environment variables:
```sh
export CORALOGIX_API_KEY="<api-key>"
export CORALOGIX_REGION="<region>"
```
For private domain set the `CORALOGIX_DOMAIN` environment variable.

3. For a custom operator image, build and push your image:
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/coralogix-operator:<tag> 
```

4. Deploy the operator to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:
```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/coralogix-operator:<tag> 
```
Note: This will install cert-manager on the cluster if it is not already installed.

5. To uninstall the operator, run:
```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).
It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the Desired state is reached on the cluster.
