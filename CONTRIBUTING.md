### Building the Operator
---------------------
1. Clone the operator repository and navigate to the project directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/coralogix/coralogix-operator.git 
cd coralogix-operator
```

2. Set the Coralogix API key and region as environment variables:
```sh
export CORALOGIX_API_KEY="<api-key>"
export CORALOGIX_REGION="<region>"
```

3. For a custom operator image, build and push your image to a registry:
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/coralogix-operator:<tag> 
```

4. Deploy the operator to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:
```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/coralogix-operator:<tag> 
```

Note: This will install Prometheus Operator CRDs on the cluster if not already installed.

5. To uninstall the operator, run:
```sh
make undeploy
```

### Running examples
---------------------
The project provides a [sample directory](./config/samples) for examples of custom resources.

To use an example, apply the resource to the cluster:
```sh
$ kubectl apply -f config/samples/v1beta1/alerts/metric_threshold.yaml
```

Getting the resource:
```sh
$ kubectl get alert metric-threshold -o yaml
```

Deleting the resource.
```sh
$ kubectl delete alert metric-threshold
```

Developing
---------------------
We use [kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/) for developing the operator.
When creating or updating CRDs remember to run:
```sh
make manifests generate
````

Running E2E Tests
---------------------
The test files are located at [./tests/e2e/](./tests/e2e).
In order to run the full e2e tests suite:
1. Add the api key and region as environment variables:
```sh
$ export CORALOGIX_API_KEY="<api-key>"
$ export CORALOGIX_REGION="<region>"
```
2. Run the tests:
```sh
$ make e2e-tests
````

Running Integration Tests
---------------------
We use [kuttl](https://kuttl.dev/) for integration tests.
The test files are located at [./tests/integration/](./tests/integration).
In order to run the full integration tests suite, run:
```sh
$ make integration-tests
````

*Note:* `kuttl` tests create real resources and in a case of failure some resources may not be removed.

Releases
---------------------
To determine the release convention we use [semantic-release](.releaserc.json) -
```sh
"releaseRules": [
          {"message": "major*", "release": "major"},
          {"message": "minor*", "release": "minor"},
          {"message": "patch*", "release": "patch"}
        ]
